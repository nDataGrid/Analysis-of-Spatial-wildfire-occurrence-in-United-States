# Analysis of Spatial wildfire occurrence in United States


**Introduction**

Wildfires are the uncontrolled fires triggered by nature or human activities in forest or rural areas. Wildfires every year has caused far beyond damage not only to millions of trees but also to the environment and living conditions of the residents. These losses are particularly severe where fires affect large areas and are of high severity. Exposure to fire smoke can be a serious health threat, short-term effects include respiratory infections, asthma, conjunctivitis and aggravating of chronic conditions, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The economic losses related to wildfires range from negligible to several million US dollars. The United States, Canada and Australia are the countries where the highest number of wildfire events ever happened. Wildfires are among the most common forms of natural disaster in certain regions of the United States.

**Dataset**

To further drill down into USAâ€™s history of wildfires, we found a dataset (SQLite database) that contains detailed records of wildfires that took place in America between 1992 and 2018. The dataset was taken from archives of the Forest Service Research & Development (FS R&D) department. These records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organisations. The dataset contains more than 2 million observations and includes 37 variables of study. In this initial phase, we will select variables as required. This will allow us to analyse the impact of wildfires from different perspectives.

The dataset includes variables which tell when and where the fire took place. These variables can help us understand the role of location, environment, or the cause of fire. Further the data can be divided into fire class, different causes of fire and in terms of geography. We will also be able to understand year to year differences between wildfires as well as states to state differences.

**Target of this Project**

Due to these continuous events, we can throw some light on the history of wildfires in the USA. We will try to answer questions such as: * How many wildfires originated in each year from 1992 till 2018? * How many Fire Classes occurred? * What was the origin of wildfires? * Which US state had the maximum number of wildfires?

And finally, we will be coming to an interesting conclusion.
