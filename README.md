# Basic-Statistics-And-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

In this course, we will learn to use the standard methods of descriptive statistics necessary for further study in data analytics. We will then apply these methods to analyze, organize, and visualize the important characteristics of sample datasets through exploratory data analysis --an approach to analyzing, organizing and visually representing the important characteristics of data sets in order to summarize their main characteristics and generate insights.
